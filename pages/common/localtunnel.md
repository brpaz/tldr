# localtunnel

> localtunnel exposes your localhost to the world for easy testing and sharing!
> No need to mess with DNS or deploy just to have others test out your changes.

- Open localtunnel on port:

`lt --port 8000`

- Run localtunnel on subdomain:

`lt --subdomain example.com`

- proxy to hostname rather than localhost:

`lt --local-host myhost`
